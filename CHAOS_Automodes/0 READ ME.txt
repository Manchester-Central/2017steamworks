Syntax (In text file):
	string "/Preferences/Auto Stage X"="State;Condition\x3DValue"
		('\x3D' represents the '=' character)
		X = the number of the stage; the order sequence value
		State = the actions which the robot will perform
		Conditions = the means that must be met to get out of the State
		Value = the value for the conditions
Syntax (In Dashboard):

States:
	Straight drive = "forward"
	Turn = "right" (will turn right if not given explicit "distanceAngle" condition with negative value)
	Wait = "wait"
	Light Follow = "follow"
	Retract Gear = "retract"
	Do Nothing = "none"
Condition:
	Distance = "distance=value" [value is a distance value in inches] 
	Time = "time=value" [value is a time in milliseconds]
	Gyro Angle = "angle=value" [value is an angle in degrees where right is positive and left is negative]
	Encoder Angle = "distanceAngle=value" [value is an anglein degrees where right is positive and left is negative]
	None = "none=none"
Examples:
	string "/Preferences/Auto Stage 1"="forward;distance\x3D75"
	string "/Preferences/Auto Stage 2"="wait;time\x3D1500"
